This project is my educational project. Here I create small python programs and auto tests to demonstrate my skills. 

These auto tests include API tests, UI tests using Selenium and integration tests, that work with DB.

All the tests are divided into bunches by means of fixtures.

To run the tests type: 

python -m pytest -m <NAME_OF_FIXTURE_TO_RUN> -s

Also in this repository you can find some simple Python programs, that I wrote while learning Python.
